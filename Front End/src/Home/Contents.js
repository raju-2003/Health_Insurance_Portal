        <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
        <p>
        Health insurance provides crucial financial protection and access to healthcare services.
        Here are some key benefits of having health insurance. Health insurance helps cover the costs of
        medical expenses, including hospitalization, doctor visits, surgeries, and prescribed
        medications.</p>
        <p> Many health insurance plans offer coverage for preventive
        services such as vaccinations, screenings, and annual check-ups. This promotes early
        detection and prevention of diseases. Health emergencies can happen unexpectedly. Health
        insurance ensures that you receive necessary emergency care without incurring substantial
        out-of-pocket expenses. Some health conditions require specialized
        medical care. </p>
        <p>Health insurance provides access to a network of specialists for expert
        consultations and treatments. Health insurance offers protection against
        exorbitant healthcare costs. It helps mitigate the financial burden associated with
        expensive medical procedures or chronic illnesses. </p>
        <p>Many health insurance plans provide coverage for
        prescription medications, reducing the cost of necessary drugs prescribed by healthcare
        professionals. Comprehensive health insurance often includes mental
        health coverage, offering support and resources for mental well-being and access to
        therapists or counselors. </p>
